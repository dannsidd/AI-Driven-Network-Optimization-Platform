# 🤖 AI-Driven Network Optimization Platform 🌐

A beginner-friendly prototype to explore how to combine **Mininet**, **Python**, and **Machine Learning** 🤓 to optimize network paths using real, emulated latency data.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Simulate a small network, measure & analyze latency, and use a basic ML model to identify the path with the lowest latency.
- **Tools**:
  - ⚙️ **Mininet** – network emulation
  - 🐍 **Python** – for data handling
  - 📊 **pandas**, 🧠 **scikit-learn**, 📈 **matplotlib** – for ML and visualization

---

## 🖧 1. Mininet Setup & Topology

### 📐 Network Topology

Create a simple topology of **3 hosts** connected to **1 switch**:

```bash
sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller=default
```

---

## 🧾 2. Data Collection & Storage

Simulate pings between hosts and save latency metrics in a CSV file called: `network_latency.csv`

### 📂 Example CSV

```csv
Source,Destination,MinRTT,AvgRTT,MaxRTT
h1,h2,0.078,0.578,4.153
h1,h3,0.072,0.990,8.409
h2,h3,0.074,0.739,5.424
```

---

## 🧠 3. Python + ML Analysis

Create a script called `network_optimizer.py` that performs the following:

### 🔍 Functionality

- 📥 Loads the CSV latency data
- 🏷️ Labels the best path based on **lowest AvgRTT**
- 📈 Visualizes the paths and their latencies
- 🧠 Trains a basic ML model to predict optimal paths

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### ✅ Setup Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 🚀 Run Script

```bash
python3 network_optimizer.py
```

### 📊 Output

- A graph showing path performance
- Printed output indicating the best-performing path
